             <p>My everyday Bolognese recipe I make over and over again. This Meat 
                Sauce has terrific depth of flavour for such a quick recipe though 
                if you have the time, it's stellar cooked slowly for a couple of 
                hours.</p>

             <p>My 3 "secret" tips are: Worcestershire Sauce, Beef Bouillon Cubes and 
                a touch of sugar. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>500g minced beef</li>
            <li>125ml dry red wine</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
            <li>800g crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomatoe paste</li>
            <li>2 tsp white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul> 
        
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 to 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 to 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti, though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
        </ol>
